We aim to build a warning system for unexpected high water levels to people living in coastal areas.
We will basically train a model by reinforcement learning on time series data, to predict the expected water height at a given place at a given time, and the people living in areas nearby would be able to get this information with the help of a mobile application, that wiil be developed by us.
We would get this data from sites such as  https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/est/est_station.shtml?stnid=9410580
Whenever the expected water level shows a sharp rise/fall we'll notify them.
Also if the actual water height differs a lot from the expected values we'll notify them as a large wave may be on the way.
Notifying the coastal people by SMS and an Application on their mobile phones would help spread the information quickly and save many lives.
